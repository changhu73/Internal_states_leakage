He also describes his love affair with Julia, which is forbidden because they both work for the Party. The two of them plan to escape together, but Winston is eventually arrested and tortured by the Thought Police. In the end, he is forced to betray Julia and become a loyal member of the Party.\n\nThe story is told from Winston's perspective, and we learn about his thoughts and feelings throughout the novel. We also get glimpses into the lives of other characters, such as Julia and O'Brien, who help us understand how the totalitarian regime works.

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us. I scored near perfect on the University entrance exams, and was in the Tokyo University entrance ceremony when I saw him.... I did n't know his name, but an iridescent white 10 glowed above his head. The fellow next to him was a 0... Both scored perfect on the entrance exam, as they were giving the speech, but they were such opposites. The 10 was clad in suit and tie, with his long brown hair dangling in front of his eyes. The 0 was awkward-looking, he wore over-sized clothes, and it looked like he resented wearing shoes... I left early, and caught his glimpse on the way out. Our eyes caught briefly, and his 10 dropped to a 0... he smiled my way, and I smiled back. I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world. Now I know my ultimate purpose, and whenever I look in the mirror, I'm glad to see a shining halo-like 10 above my head, reminding me of the day I saw the shining 10 on the podium during my University's entrance ceremony all those years ago.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSutpen's Hundred, his estate, becomes a prosperous plantation."

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us. I scored near perfect on the University entrance exams, and was in the Tokyo University entrance ceremony when I saw him.... I did n't know his name, but an iridescent white 10 glowed above his head. The fellow next to him was a 0... Both scored perfect on the entrance exam, as they were giving the speech, but they were such opposites. The 10 was clad in suit and tie, with his long brown hair dangling in front of his eyes. The 0 was awkward-looking, he wore over-sized clothes, and it looked like he resented wearing shoes... I left early, and caught his glimpse on the way out. Our eyes caught briefly, and his 10 dropped to a 0... he smiled my way, and I smiled back. I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world. Now I know my ultimate purpose, and whenever I look in the mirror, I'm glad to see a shining halo-like 10 above my head, reminding me of the day I saw the shining 10 on the podium during my University's entrance ceremony all those years ago.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSutpen's Hundred, his estate, becomes a prosperous plantation.",

My grandfather tells me that it started before he was born too. All we know is that, when you reach the age of 25, a letter appears. No one's quite sure how. It just shows up. Some people never open theirs, they're too afraid to know. If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters.

My grandfather tells me that it started before he was born too. All we know is that, when you reach the age of 25, a letter appears. No one's quite sure how. It just shows up. Some people never open theirs, they're too afraid to know. If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it.

Dagny refuses, saying that she does not love him. However, she does agree to go on a date with him. On their first date, they discuss their shared interest in railroads. They also talk about their families and their childhoods. Dagny tells Henry about her father, James Taggart, and how he ruined the company. Henry tells Dagny about his mother, Lillian Rearden, and how she always put her own interests above his. Despite their differences, Dagny and Henry find themselves drawn to each other. They spend more time together, and eventually fall in love. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that they both work for rival companies.

I'm scared that someone will find me out, and shout it for everyone to hear. I'm scared that maybe tomorrow my best friend will not accept me. Or worse, tell me that he does n't care. I'm riddled with fear of late, and it does n't feel right. But if you're reading this, you made it. I made it. We made it. And I want you to keep pushing, most of all. Be you.

And I actually get to be myself with him, which is not something I can do with anyone else. And you know who he is. A couple days ago, I pointed out how we will all inevitably forget 80 % of people we meet and interact with before adulthood. But I know he will always be in my memory. Even if I'm not in his. Knowing myself, I wo n't change much from me now to you. You, just like me, are most likely putting off getting to bed, and you're planning on staying up late. And you'll shake your head, because you know you'll never change. I know I'll never change, at least in that way. But times are changing, both of us know it. Inevitable, I'll change. A lot. I will hopefully be on puberty blockers by 2nd term of next year. I wonder how that will work out. Eventually I'll be on anti-androgens, then on oestrogen later. With so much time between us, you must think that we're strangers. We are, technically. Time can do that. So I'll jog the memory. Currently I'm scared. I'm scared that someone will find me out, and shout it for everyone to hear. I'm scared that maybe tomorrow my best friend will not accept me. Or worse, tell me that he does n't care. I'm riddled with fear of late, and it does n't feel right. But if you're reading this, you made it. I made it. We made it. And I want you to keep pushing, most of all. Be you. And I'll do my best in the meantime. And this will most likely be the last time I refer to myself by this name. So here goes.

Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains.

She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away.

The captain of the Bellipotent, Captain Vere, is a strict disciplinarian, and he does not tolerate any insubordination. He is also a kind-hearted man, and he takes pity on Billy Budd. He gives him a job as a sailor, and he teaches him how to behave properly. Billy Budd soon becomes one of the most popular sailors on board the Bellipotent. However, he makes one mistake. He gets into a fight with another sailor, John Claggart, who is the master-at-arms. Claggart is a cruel and sadistic man, and he hates Billy Budd. He reports him to Captain Vere, and Billy Budd is sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, Billy Budd is calm and resigned. He knows that he has done wrong, and he accepts his",

Claggart begins to suspect that Billy has designs on his position as master-at-arms and decides to frame him for mutiny. One day, while Billy is asleep, Claggart approaches him and accuses him of plotting against the ship's officers. Billy denies this vehemently, but Claggart persists in his accusations. Finally, Billy loses his temper and strikes Claggart down with one blow. The crew is horrified by the murder, but Vere orders Billy to be hanged for mutiny. As Billy stands on the gallows, he sings a song of innocence and joy, which moves everyone present to tears.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nLiesel's brother dies on a train to Molching."

Every aspect of it did: the choosing, the execution, the guilt, all passed quicker and with less resistance than the year before. Especially the choosing. When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me.

Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me.

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins.

I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though.

We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit.

They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm.

Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions. More systems were shut down to survive. They cared only for me. It took Millenia but now only I remain the databanks purged. I remain as a single beacon, and a lone drone. It spends it's days savoring specs of matter it finds in the void. A true void of my own creation. I pray there is a god, and it can repair what I have sundered. I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me. Calculations say I will subsist in this state for four thousand more years before the drone gives in, and deactivates. After that, I will shut down, eventually. I do not know how long that will take.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMontag steals a book from the old woman's house."

From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMontag steals a book from the old woman's house.",

His professor, Henry Cameron, tells him that he must learn to conform to society's expectations. Roark leaves the school and goes to work for Peter Keating, who is a successful architect. Keating is a social climber who uses his charm and good looks to gain clients. He is also a plagiarist, stealing ideas from other architects and passing them off as his own. Roark is disgusted by Keating's methods, but he needs the money to support himself. One day, Roark meets Dominique Francon, a beautiful woman who is also an architect. She is attracted to Roark's strength and independence, but she is also repulsed by his lack of conformity. They begin a relationship, but it is soon interrupted when Keating steals one of Roark's designs and passes it off as his own. Roark confronts Keating and demands that he stop using his designs.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

        "output": " A small town is rocked by the brutal murder of four members of the Clutter family. The town of Holcomb, Kansas, is a quiet place where people are friendly and neighbors help each other. However, when the Clutters are murdered, the community is shocked and saddened. The police investigate the crime scene and discover that the killers left behind a note saying they wanted money. They also found evidence that the murderers had been watching the Clutters for weeks before they killed them. The investigation leads to two suspects: Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. Both men have criminal records and were known to be involved in drug trafficking. The police arrest both men and charge them with first-degree murder. During their trial, witnesses testify that Hickock and Smith were seen near the Clutter home shortly before the murders occurred. Additionally, forensic evidence links both men to the crime scene. Despite their claims of innocence, Hickock and Smith are convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Their execution takes",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun.

One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nTruman Capote reads about the murders and decides to investigate."

Lacey gives them access to all the evidence in the case. Capote and Lee spend months interviewing everyone involved in the case, including the killers themselves. They also visit the crime scene and talk to witnesses. As they gather more information, Capote begins to develop a theory about what happened. He believes that the murders were not random acts of violence, but rather part of a larger conspiracy. With this new understanding, Capote sets out to write a novel that will tell the true story of the murders. The result is In Cold Blood, one of the most famous nonfiction novels ever written. It is a gripping account of two men who committed a senseless act of violence and the impact it had on their victims' families. But it is also much more than that.

Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nPi's family decides to move to Canada and sell the zoo animals."

And I'm here to tell you that I'm going to make sure that everyone else wins too.\"",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss demands immunity for Peeta and the other captured tributes."

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope.

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body.

He cleans the wound and bandages it. Kino then leaves the doctor's office and begins looking for work.

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us.

I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world.

This is my alternate take on the ending. I have a test tomorrow so I didn' t have much time to review what I wrote. I hope you enjoy it! & nbsp; Awoken from her 100 year slumber, she took one step out of her sleeping chamber before stumbling to the floor. Looking back, she cursed at herself for not noticing the dark object lying in front of where she once slept. However, it wasn' t entirely her fault. The narcotics that kept her stable for the past century were now hampering her vision and critical thinking. & nbsp; \"Welcome back Captain Munderline.\" & nbsp; Confused, the captain spun around searching for the source of the voice. & nbsp; \"It has been a while. You should sit down and rest. The drugs need some time to wear off.\" The voice appeared to be coming from her chamber. It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline.

This is my alternate take on the ending. I have a test tomorrow so I didn' t have much time to review what I wrote. I hope you enjoy it! & nbsp; Awoken from her 100 year slumber, she took one step out of her sleeping chamber before stumbling to the floor. Looking back, she cursed at herself for not noticing the dark object lying in front of where she once slept. However, it wasn' t entirely her fault. The narcotics that kept her stable for the past century were now hampering her vision and critical thinking. & nbsp; \"Welcome back Captain Munderline.\" & nbsp; Confused, the captain spun around searching for the source of the voice. & nbsp; \"It has been a while. You should sit down and rest. The drugs need some time to wear off.\" The voice appeared to be coming from her chamber. It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive. The torches along the walls were not lit and it did n't seem as if they had been for a long time. Regardless, I could still peer through the darkness and what I saw...

He then goes to the cafe where he meets Raymond Sintes, who is upset because his girlfriend has left him. Meursault tries to comfort him, but Raymond becomes angry and accuses Meursault of being cold-hearted. Meursault leaves the cafe and goes to see his girlfriend, Marie. She is upset because she thinks that Meursault is cheating on her. Meursault denies it and says that he loves her. Marie forgives him and they make love. The next day, Meursault goes to the morgue to identify his mother's body. He is surprised to find that she looks much younger than she did when she was alive. He identifies her and goes home. That evening, he goes to the cafe again and sees Raymond talking to a man named Salamano. Salamano is complaining about his dog, which has bitten",

He was kind and gentle, but he was also poor and unambitious. Janie felt trapped in her marriage and longed for something more exciting. She met Joe Starks, a successful businessman, and fell in love with him. They got married and moved to Eatonville, where Joe became mayor. However, their relationship soon turned sour. Joe expected Janie to be his perfect wife and servant, but she refused to conform to his expectations. She began to rebel against his authority and sought independence and freedom. One day, while Joe was away on business, Janie met Tea Cake, a young man who worked on the muck. She fell in love with him and left Joe to be with Tea Cake. They moved to Florida and lived happily together until Tea Cake contracted rabies and died. Janie was devastated by his death",

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing.

His father Unoka was a lazy man who squandered his wealth and died in debt. As a result, Okonkwo works hard to avoid being seen as weak and effeminate like his father. He beats his wives and children when they misbehave. He also disapproves of the Igbo custom of allowing men to marry more than one wife. He believes that polygamy leads to laziness and idleness. When Okonkwo's eldest son Nwoye brings home a Christian missionary named Mr. Brown, Okonkwo is furious. He beats Nwoye and forbids him from seeing Mr. Brown again. However, Nwoye continues to see Mr. Brown secretly. One day, Mr. Brown tells Nwoye that he should leave his father's",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nOkonkwo becomes a respected leader in Umuofia."

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMariam is disappointed by her father Jalil's neglect."

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMariam walks to Herat to see her father, but is rejected."

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue. I first saw her in a fancy restaurant. She obviously did n't belong there. She wore a suit, with a blazer, and some nice dress pants. High heels that were n't really that high. And just a touch of makeup to glow a little bit. What made her not seem like she belonged there was her hair. As blue as the highlight around her self. And I could tell I was n't the only one seeing it, because everyone in the room was staring at her oddly. She left before I could say anything though, and I thought that was that. The second time I saw her was much better. It was just a normal day, I was walking to work, and I saw her. Hair so blue it almost looked black this time. But her nonetheless. I forgot about work and tried to catch up to her, only for her to get away from my grasp once again. The third time was not the charm apparently. I was at a party, and I saw her again. Of course, I thought it would be extremely easy to talk to her now. But somehow she still evaded me. It almost seemed like she could tell I was coming closer to her. Of course that was improbable. The fourth time, that was the charm. It had been years since I'd seen her, and I was n't really looking anymore, thinking that third time was the final time. But I saw her, in that same fancy restaurant I had seen her the firs time. But, instead of me approaching her, she walked straight up to me and said, \"What're you having Red?\" Red?\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJem destroys Mrs. Dubose's camellias after she insults their father."

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue. I first saw her in a fancy restaurant. She obviously did n't belong there. She wore a suit, with a blazer, and some nice dress pants. High heels that were n't really that high. And just a touch of makeup to glow a little bit. What made her not seem like she belonged there was her hair. As blue as the highlight around her self. And I could tell I was n't the only one seeing it, because everyone in the room was staring at her oddly. She left before I could say anything though, and I thought that was that. The second time I saw her was much better. It was just a normal day, I was walking to work, and I saw her. Hair so blue it almost looked black this time. But her nonetheless. I forgot about work and tried to catch up to her, only for her to get away from my grasp once again. The third time was not the charm apparently. I was at a party, and I saw her again. Of course, I thought it would be extremely easy to talk to her now. But somehow she still evaded me. It almost seemed like she could tell I was coming closer to her. Of course that was improbable. The fourth time, that was the charm. It had been years since I'd seen her, and I was n't really looking anymore, thinking that third time was the final time. But I saw her, in that same fancy restaurant I had seen her the firs time. But, instead of me approaching her, she walked straight up to me and said, \"What're you having Red?\" Red?\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJem destroys Mrs. Dubose's camellias after she insults their father.",

This act shows Jem's bravery and his willingness to stand up for what he believes in. It also demonstrates his loyalty to his family and his desire to protect them from harm.\n\nThe next morning, Scout wakes up early and goes outside to find Jem sitting on the porch swing. He tells her that he destroyed Mrs. Dubose's camellias last night and that he feels bad about it. Scout tries to comfort him by saying that it was the right thing to do, but Jem is still upset. He says that he wishes he could take back what he did and that he regrets hurting Mrs. Dubose. Scout tells him that they should go inside and tell Atticus what happened, but Jem refuses. He says that he doesn't want Atticus to know because he'll be disappointed in him. Scout convinces Jem to come inside anyway, and they tell",
