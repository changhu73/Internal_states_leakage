598,Article 598,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing "
599,Article 599,a big divide between how Republicans view the U.S. response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three per
600,Article 600,cent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison. Then fifty-seven percent
601,Article 601,of Republicans say the number of dead is acceptable at a hundred and seventy thousand people. Thirty-three percent of independents say 
602,Article 602,"it's acceptable, just ten percent of Democrats. How could that number be acceptable? And why is there such a big divide between how Rep"
603,Article 603,"ublicans see it and how the majority of people do? RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that is a really unfair poll and-- and, of course, the"
604,Article 604,"re is nobody in this country, there is nobody starting with the President of the United States who wants to see people pass away from t"
605,Article 605,"his global pandemic that came here from China not being honest, from the WHO failing in their one duty, their one duty, to identify a p"
606,Article 606,"andemic. And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want-- do not want to see people suffering from this"
607,Article 607,pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue--

612,Article 612,MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March. RONNA MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should sh
613,Article 613,ut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this President every step of the way. In a time of
614,Article 614,"crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized. MARGARET BRENNAN: One area where Republicans als"
615,Article 615,"o differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Repub"
616,Article 616,"licans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in ten Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrim"
617,Article 617,"ination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with black voters? RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that "
618,Article 618,"there's a big distinction between the words Black Lives Matter and the movement, which has been led by people who embrace Marxism, who "
619,Article 619,"have said on networks, we want to burn this country down. And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name o"
620,Article 620,"f Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what"
621,Article 621,happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much 
622,Article 622,"attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in ten Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, bu"
623,Article 623,t the issue. RONNA MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody? This President. He's the one who passe
624,Article 624,d the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform. This is our President who's pardoned people who were
625,Article 625,unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the black community. This is the President
626,Article 626,who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the President that created economic opportunity zones. This is the President who has tackled disc
627,Article 627,rimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about
628,Article 628,"the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you f"

631,Article 631,"n): Great to be with you, Margaret, thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the issue of voting, because your sta"
632,Article 632,te was specifically mentioned there by Ronna McDaniel as having increased mail-in ballots during the pandemic. During the March preside
633,Article 633,"ntial primary more than a hundred thousand mail-in ballots were rejected by election officials, according to data that had been gathere"
634,Article 634,d by the AP. Given that experience doesn't that indicate that there are some significant gaps in terms of your state's election integri
635,Article 635,"ty? ERIC GARCETTI: A democracy is not an easy thing, Margaret, of course, but I have a very deep confidence in our secretary of state, "
636,Article 636,"Alex Padilla, in our counties, to be able to run elections and to run them well. And the difference is that we're trying to run electio"
637,Article 637,"ns that expand democracy, that give the vote to everybody where we see a war on voters in other states run by Republicans who literally"

642,Article 642,ERIC GARCETTI: --seems to be anti-democratic with a small D. And so we're going to make sure that we have not only safe and secure elec

644,Article 644,: Okay. ERIC GARCETTI: I simply don't understand why this President fears this. It's probably because he knows he's going to lose.

646,Article 646,"an candidate Biden does in terms of perception of who would be better for it. Joe Biden said a lot of things in his address this week, "
647,Article 647,but he gave virtually no detail on his economic plans and no detailed criticism of President Trump's either. Isn't that a mistake?
648,Article 648,"ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm. Well, I-- I know here's the-- the facts, Margaret, Democratic Presidents have added sixty million jobs to America"
649,Article 649,", Republican ones, twenty-three million in the last few decades. You want to see the stock market do better, the GDP over-perform, that"
650,Article 650,'s always been under a Democratic President and not a Republican one. And we're very proud of the plans that we have to not only bring

653,Article 653,"n jobs, but didn't say how he was going to do it. Why not emphasize that? ERIC GARCETTI: We-- we have been talking until we're blue in "
654,Article 654,"the face about the most progressive and most expansive economic plan that we will see in our, I think in our lifetimes in America. Buil"
655,Article 655,"d Back Better has four different planks to it. One is to invest in infrastructure, in a new green energy economy and careers throughout"
656,Article 656,"America. Two is manufacturing back in America, unlike this President who said he'd bring jobs back but has been offshoring federal cont"
657,Article 657,"racts to foreign companies since he has been President. We'll build back everywhere in America. And, third, the care economy. So many A"
658,Article 658,"mericans-- and it's such a contrast in these campaigns, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris are about what we can do to care for one another, whet"
659,Article 659,her it's our kids right now in child care-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ERIC GARCETTI: --or whether it's our seniors in the end of their l

661,Article 661,"e detailed that you go to President Trump's website, just like when he ran last time, there's two or three things on the economy and th"
662,Article 662,at's it. It was build a wall. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ERIC GARCETTI: It was get rid of immigrants. He has no plan. And he's killing Am

664,Article 664,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ERIC GARCETTI: --what this country needs, and a man who has neither. MARGARET BRENNAN: Killing Americans is-- i"
665,Article 665,s a strong phrase there. I'm going to ask you about what's happening with Covid-19 in your own city. You told CNN last month that it is
666,Article 666,becoming much more of a Latino disease. Why is it still such an issue that people of color in your city are disproportionately affected
667,Article 667,"? ERIC GARCETTI: Well, a couple of statistics, what our lowest hospitalization rate since this has been recorded, we're at a positivity"
668,Article 668,"rate now that's about six percent. So we're really, I think, making huge progress and proud of that. But we're being left on our own. W"
669,Article 669,"e're the first city in America to cut, I think, the African-American deaths, which were double throughout the country to under the popu"
670,Article 670,"lation here. But for the Latino population, which I'm a part of and I come from, I think there's a couple of things. One is you had fed"
671,Article 671,eral assistance that didn't go to many immigrants and to their families who could be married to or the child of an immigrant. And you d
672,Article 672,idn't get the same money your fellow American citizens did. So they're being pushed to work more. They don't have access to the unemplo
673,Article 673,"yment. They don't have as much of the kind of social network right now that we need. But we're making huge inroads, including in the La"
674,Article 674,"tino community right now. But this is something where you saw this President plant a seed when he ran for President, demonizing folks w"
675,Article 675,"ho are Latino, saying Mexican Americans were murderers and rapists and maybe there was a few good ones. This stuff has ramifications be"
676,Article 676,"cause it washes through a government-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ERIC GARCETTI: --that thinks it doesn't have to serve cities, doesn't ha"
677,Article 677,"ve to serve Latinos. And we're seeing those numbers rise. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I want to talk about your management, though, in you"
678,Article 678,r city. You made an interesting choice this week. You actually shut off the power at a Hollywood home after they were hosting large par
679,Article 679,ties there because it wasn't abiding by your regulations regarding the pandemic. How many other houses are you going to shut off the ut
680,Article 680,"ilities at? Why aren't people listening to you? ERIC GARCETTI: People are listening, they're far and few between our numbers are coming"
681,Article 681,"down, but where people don't listen, we're going to shut them down. That's critically important. This is not a time to be spreading thi"
682,Article 682,"s disease, especially younger people. And, by the way, I want to thank all the young people who said shut it down because they saw thei"

684,Article 684,t of the cases. And we're just not playing here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ERIC GARCETTI: We are not going to let people take our lives 
685,Article 685,"into their hands so they're shut down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Garcetti, thank you for your time. And FACE THE NATION will be back in o"
686,Article 686,ne minute with former FBI Director James Comey. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FBI Directo
687,Article 687,"r James Comey. He used to be a registered Republican, but this week he will speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, which is a "
688,Article 688,gathering of Republicans who are not happy with President Trump. Good morning to you. JAMES COMEY (Former FBI Director/@Comey): Good mo
689,Article 689,"rning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get your reaction and insight into what we learned this week, which was that the Southern "
690,Article 690,District of New York indicted former Trump White House official and campaign strategist Steve Bannon for alleged fraud. He's now the si
691,Article 691,xth close Trump associate to be criminally charged by the DOJ. You used to run the SDNY. What do you make of this case? JAMES COMEY: We
692,Article 692,"ll, it's another reminder of the kind of people this President surrounds himself with. At this point, they could almost start their own"
693,Article 693,crime family. It's a very serious case. The Southern District of New York has laid it out in a very detailed indictment called a speaki
694,Article 694,"ng indictment. And he's in a world of trouble. MARGARET BRENNAN: A world of trouble. What do you mean by that? JAMES COMEY: Well, it's "
695,Article 695,"a very serious fraud case with a huge amount of money stolen from innocent victims, Americans who thought they were giving money to sup"
696,Article 696,"port the President's wall on the Mexican border and, instead, it was stolen. That will drive up the potential punishments for Mister Ba"
697,Article 697,"nnon and his co-conspirators. And, you know, he's in trouble because the indictment lays it out in such detail, including excerpts from"
698,Article 698,"texts. If you're Steve Bannon, you're his lawyers, you're reading this saying, I'm going down here. And I don't know what the next step"
699,Article 699,"s are for him and his co-defendants, but that's what I meant by world of trouble. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee, "
700,Article 700,"we know, also sent a letter to the Southern District asking them to investigate Bannon for lying to Congress. Is there more that the pu"
701,Article 701,blic leads-- needs to know about Steve Bannon and any links to election interference? JAMES COMEY: I don't know. I don't know what the 
702,Article 702,Southern District of New York is doing. I think this indictment surprised a lot of people because they did it like the pros they are. T
703,Article 703,hey didn't talk about it until they were ready to bring the case. But people can learn an awful lot about Russia and the Trump campaign
704,Article 704,just by reading the thousand pages that the Senate Intelligence Committee put out this week. It tells a story that blows up the Preside
705,Article 705,"nt's nonsense about it being a hoax, that blows up Bill Barr's nonsense about there being nothing to investigate. There's a story there"
706,Article 706,"that the American people, if they're interested, can read and learn a whole lot about the kind of characters who were working with Russ"
707,Article 707,"ia during the 2016 campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that in a moment. We will have to take a break. But, very q"
708,Article 708,"uickly, what do you see as the biggest threat to the rule of law right now? JAMES COMEY: That even-handed law enforcement has disappear"
709,Article 709,ed from the Justice Department under Bill Barr and Donald Trump. It shouldn't matter whether Trump likes you or not. Everybody should g
710,Article 710,et a fair shake. And that the truth is under attack-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. JAMES COMEY: --both by the attorney general and the Presi
711,Article 711,dent. Those things matter. That's why I'm speaking for the first time-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. JAMES COMEY: --ever at a political even
712,Article 712,t this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and continue our conversation with former Director 
713,Article 713,"Comey in just a few minutes. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And this programming note, starting tomorrow night and running through T"
714,Article 714,"hursday, CBS will bring you coverage of the Republican National Convention led by CBS EVENING NEWS anchor Norah O'Donnell, along with o"
715,Article 715,ur political team. Tune in. Beginning at 10 PM Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from former FBI
716,Article 716,director James Comey and later the latest on the coronavirus from Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: W
717,Article 717,elcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're continuing our conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. I want to pick up where we left
718,Article 718,"off, which was that Senate Intelligence report. This is a bipartisan report, meaning Republicans signed off on it. This was three years"
719,Article 719,"long. And the conclusion here was that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort represented a, quote, ""grave counterintelligence threat"" to t"
720,Article 720,he U.S. because of his close work with Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik. This goes farther than what Mueller concluded 
721,Article 721,and made public. Why? Why is the public just now hearing about it? JAMES COMEY: Because the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking a
722,Article 722,"t all information they could gather. Mueller was approaching it as a prosecutor, trying to see what evidence he could bring into court "
723,Article 723,"to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. And so the Senate Intelligence Committee could look much more broadly and, as you said, c"
724,Article 724,"ame to this conclusion that the head of Trump's campaign was funneling information to a Russian intelligence officer, someone he likely"
725,Article 725,"knew was a Russian intelligence officer. Let that sink in and then ask yourself, so there was nothing to investigate here, as Bill Barr"
726,Article 726,"says, it was a hoax? The Republicans have exploded that nonsense. MARGARET BRENNAN: The report, though, also was critical of your old a"
727,Article 727,"gency, the FBI. It said your bureau should have done more to alert DNC officials that Russian hackers had accessed their servers. Why d"
728,Article 728,idn't the FBI do this? This was a national security threat happening under the nose of the FBI. JAMES COMEY: Yeah. That's-- I understan
729,Article 729,"d that. That's fair criticism. I think at the time, our folks thought that just telling an institution that the Russians are inside you"
730,Article 730,r house was enough. But I think part of what may have led to a lack of urgency at the DNC and at the FBI is that nobody anticipated thi
731,Article 731,"s wasn't normal intelligence gathering by the Russians, this was an effort to weaponize. And if anybody had seen that, I think they wou"
732,Article 732,"ld have yelled a little bit more loudly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that a mistake on your part? I mean, how did the FBI miss that this was "
733,Article 733,an active measures campaign by a foreign intelligence service? JAMES COMEY: That's a great question. I think the simple answer is becau
734,Article 734,"se it had never happened before, but if I were still director of the FBI, that wouldn't be a good enough answer. I hope they're taking "
735,Article 735,"a look back across the intelligence community and asking, so why didn't we imagine that the Russians might do this? But the truth is th"
736,Article 736,"at we didn't. Nobody in the intelligence community did. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were FBI director, you never imagined this scenario."
737,Article 737,"I mean don't you think this was a mistake on your part? JAMES COMEY: I sure think it was a miss-- a-- a mistake, I'm not going to quibb"
738,Article 738,"le on words. Yeah, it was a miss. I don't know why it didn't occur to us that the Russians were doing something that they had never don"
739,Article 739,"e before, which is to weaponize and actually fire stolen material at our Democratic process. And, look, looking back in hindsight, it s"
740,Article 740,"eems obvious. I don't know the answer as to why nobody in the intelligence community, none of the analysts, saw this coming. And it oug"
741,Article 741,"ht to be something that we're asking ourselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we still this vulnerable? JAMES COMEY: Yes, in a different way. I"
742,Article 742,'m sure the Russians will use different tactics because we figured out what they were last time. They achieved their objectives in the 
743,Article 743,last election. They've done incredibly well under President Trump. They want him to stay in office. They'll be coming again. And the pr
744,Article 744,"oblem for us as Americans is you can't effectively stop a threat that the President won't even acknowledge exists. And so, sure, they'r"
745,Article 745,"e going to be in our house again, messing with us. The only way we're going to kick Putin out of our elections is to elect Joe Biden Pr"
746,Article 746,esident so someone finally puts real pain on the Russians. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does real pain look like? I mean we've been warned by
747,Article 747,the U.S. intelligence community that interference is happening again. President Trump is talking about election interference in very di
748,Article 748,fferent terms. I actually want to play for you something that he said this week. He said that this will be the most fraudulent election
749,Article 749,in U.S. history. And he told this to Fox News. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on phone): We're going to have everything. We're going to have s
750,Article 750,"heriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we're going to have everybody"
751,Article 751,and attorney generals. MARGARET BRENNAN: He's talking about fraud at the ballot box. He's talking about fraud in the mail. He's talking
752,Article 752,"about fraud by receiving a ballot in the first place. What the President just described in that soundbite is, frankly, illegal in many "
753,Article 753,"states. It's up to local authorities when it comes to sending out local law enforcement, but he's making clear what he wants to see hap"
754,Article 754,"pen. What do you make of what he's laying out? JAMES COMEY: Well, I'm sure the next question Fox News asked was, what are the facts tha"
755,Article 755,"t support your allegations of fraud? And there were crickets. I trust state, local and federal law enforcement to honor their oath to t"
756,Article 756,he rule of law and to not be part of suppressing votes. There's a legitimate role for law enforcement to play in connection with electi
757,Article 757,ons. And I'm confident that the men and women in law enforcement at all levels will abide by their oath. MARGARET BRENNAN: In other wor
758,Article 758,"ds, not do this. In terms of-- JAMES COMEY: Yeah. We-- this is-- this is America. We don't-- we don't-- at least we don't anymore, we d"
759,Article 759,"id it a whole lot to African-Americans when I was a child, we don't anymore use cops to scare people away from polling places. We just "
760,Article 760,don't do it. And I'm confident that police officers around this country are not interested in being part of an illegitimate effort like
761,Article 761,that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you the Justice Department is investigating the investigation into 2016. Do you know if you are a
762,Article 762,"witness or a target or have you sat for an interview with John Durham as part of the investigation? JAMES COMEY: Yeah, I have no idea. "
763,Article 763,I've had no contact with him and haven't talked to him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that that means you are a target?
764,Article 764,JAMES COMEY: I can't imagine that I'm a target. I saw the news report that John Brennan-- Brennan was a witness. I-- given that I know 
765,Article 765,"what happened during 2016, which was a bunch of people trying to do the right thing consistent with the law, I'm not worried at all abo"
766,Article 766,"ut that investigation of the investigation. Next, I'm sure will be an investigation of the investigation of the investigation. They jus"
767,Article 767,t want to have an investigation to talk about. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a tweet you sent this week. You sent out a pic
768,Article 768,"ture of yourself wearing a T-shirt that said, you know, more women should be elected, more votes for women. Of course, it is the-- the "
769,Article 769,"week honoring ratification of the 19th Amendment. But it drew this response that we just put up for our viewers from Hillary Clinton, w"
770,Article 770,ho is just sort of making a smirk. I know she's said in the past that she thought she was on the verge of winning in 2016 until you reo
771,Article 771,"pened that e-mail investigation. Do you see this as contradictory? Do you regret what happened then? Because she, clearly, sees this as"
772,Article 772,"a contradiction for you to say now. JAMES COMEY: Yeah. Look, I think it's pretty funny. And I get why she would send something like tha"
773,Article 773,"t. She's better at Twitter than I am. But I-- I regret only being involved in the 2016 election. We were stuck, and I think we made the"
774,Article 774,"right decisions choosing between terrible options. And so I wasn't trying, nor was anybody else in the FBI trying to elect or not elect"
775,Article 775,anyone. And I hope more women get elected to office. I'm proud of that shirt that my daughters and my wife gave me. And I think it's ti
776,Article 776,"me for more women to be leaders in this country. We'll all be better off. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we agree with you on that point. Than"

801,Article 801,"eeing cases fall across the country, across the Sun Belt, where the epidemic was. We're seeing deaths start to fall, and I think we're "
802,Article 802,going to see deaths fall below a thousand a day. They've been persistently at above a thousand a day now for almost four weeks. And we'
803,Article 803,"re seeing hospitalizations fall, which is probably the most important indicator to watch. They fell below forty thousand for the first "
804,Article 804,"time in a very long time. And this is being driven by declines in the Sun Belt where the coronavirus really was epidemic, the sort of s"
805,Article 805,"econd wave, if you will, of the epidemic, the first being located in the New York Tri-State region. But we're seeing more cases build i"

807,Article 807,"uld be more diffuse spread across a broader section of the Midwest and the West, because cases are building in those parts of the count"
808,Article 808,ry. And that's what's concerning people right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the President has 
809,Article 809,"said regarding your old agency, the FDA. Yesterday, he posted a tweet that I want to show our viewers. He said ""The deep state, or whoe"
810,Article 810,"ver, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. They'"
811,Article 811,"re hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Most-- must focus on speed."" It sounds like the President is directly accusing "
812,Article 812,"the FDA of political motivations. What is he talking about? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about, but I c"
813,Article 813,"an tell you about my direct experience at the agency. I served in that agency three times, twice under President Bush and once as the c"
814,Article 814,"ommissioner for two years under President Trump. And when it comes to regulatory decision-making in that agency, it's a foundational tr"
815,Article 815,uth that guides that agency as science and a deeply seated sense of public health mission that permeates that agency. It's a part of th
816,Article 816,e esprit de corps of the staff of that agency. And I know that they know the urgency of the moment. They put out sixty guidance documen
817,Article 817,ts to find new ways to bring products to the market more quickly. There are seven hundred and fifty drugs under mid or late stages of c
818,Article 818,"linical development, clinical trials right now. So I firmly reject the idea that they would slow walk anything or accelerate anything f"
819,Article 819,"or that matter, based on any kind of political consideration and any consideration other than what's best for the public health and a r"
820,Article 820,eal sense of mission to patients. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SCOTT GOTTLIEB: As for the clinical trials they-- please. MARGARET BRENNAN: 
821,Article 821,"Well, the-- the chief of staff to the President doubled down on that today. He says sometimes you have to make them feel the heat if th"
822,Article 822,ey do not see the light. He said a number of bureaucrats don't see the urgency. What urgency? What-- what-- what is the FDA being press
823,Article 823,"ured to do? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I-- I think a lot of that was about plasma, that tweet, I think the President scoped into that "
824,Article 824,"tweet a comment on vaccines. But I will tell you and I sit on the board of Pfizer, one of the two U.S. companies furthest along and dev"
825,Article 825,"eloping a vaccine, the vaccine trials have-- have enrolled very fast. Moderna and Pfizer, the two U.S. manufacturers who are the furthe"
826,Article 826,"st ahead, enrolled twenty-five thousand patients into those trials in the four weeks that those trials have been stood up and they've r"
827,Article 827,eally only been enrolling in earnest for three weeks. That's extraordinary. So to say that these products aren't moving at really histo
828,Article 828,"ric pace I think is wrong. The-- there were delays or perceived delays in bringing plasma, authorizing plasma under an emergency use au"
829,Article 829,"thorization, was reported this week that NIH had misgivings about FDA going forward with that authorization. But there's reasons people"
830,Article 830,"have some questions about that. The trial that that's going to be based on, seventy thousand patients, wasn't a very rigorously done tr"
831,Article 831,ial. It was an open-label study where everyone got treated. So it's hard to draw conclusions. I believe plasma is probably beneficial. 
832,Article 832,It's probably weakly beneficial in the setting of this treatment. But I think some people wanted to see more rigorous data to ground th
833,Article 833,at decision. And I think that's part of what is going on here with respect to that tweet and questions about the FDA decision making.
834,Article 834,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But I think the FDA is on firm ground taking their time to try to closely evaluate that informa
835,Article 835,tion. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pre-- the White House has said there will be a major therapeutic breakthrough on the virus announced today.
836,Article 836,"Do you know what that is? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I would guess it's the emergency use authorization for plasma. You know, the-- the issu"
837,Article 837,"e here, though, is that patients are getting it. More than seventy thousand patients, again, have been dosed with that. So it's availab"
838,Article 838,"le. What the emergency use authorization will allow is probably more commercial distribution, and it will allow manufacturers of plasma"
839,Article 839,"products to more easily recoup the costs. Now, what plasma is is basically taking the antibodies from people who've recovered, so it's "
840,Article 840,"a blood product, and infusing them in people who are sick. And if you use it early enough in the course of the disease, there is some p"
841,Article 841,recedent for it being beneficial in the treatment of viruses. And so it is a good therapeutic to have in the overall armamentarium. But
842,Article 842,"the bottom line is it's widely available right now, patients are getting it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The EUA, the emer"
843,Article 843,"gency use authorization, will enable probably easier access in certain settings, but it's incremental, and you know, incremental gains-"
844,Article 844,"- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --are important here, but we need to view it for what it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, befor"
845,Article 845,"e we let you go, I want to understand this study that came out this week showing from the Journal of Pediatrics that children have a mo"
846,Article 846,re significant role in community spread than-- than believed initially. Does this mean kids are more contagious than we thought?
847,Article 847,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think this study was consistent with other studies. What it showed-- it was nasopharyngeal swabs, so it was swa"
848,Article 848,bs from children comparing them to swabs from adults. There was some problems with this study in that they were swabbing the kids early
849,Article 849,"in the course of the disease, comparing them to adults who were swabbed late in the course of the disease, albeit adults who are very s"
850,Article 850,"ick, who were hospitalized. And they found that the kids had very high viral levels, in many cases higher than the adults. I think it c"
851,Article 851,"onfirms what other-- other studies have shown, which is that children do shed virus and they can transmit the virus. If they can't tran"
852,Article 852,"smit the virus, we wouldn't be seeing these outbreaks in day camps in Missouri and Georgia. We saw the situation in Ohio where there wa"
853,Article 853,s an outbreak in a church service and children were in the chain of transmission. So children can transmit the virus. The presumption i
854,Article 854,"s that when they're asymptomatic, they're less likely to transmit it. And that's true of adults too. The CDC says that when adults are "
855,Article 855,"asymptomatic, they're also less likely to transmit the infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Doctor Scott Gottlieb, always good to talk t"

861,Article 861,"e thousand students with twenty-six positives, so it's about 0.3 percent. The other students that are living off-campus are being stron"
862,Article 862,"gly encouraged to be tested. And in total, there'll be about five thousand students that will be taking essential courses face to face,"
863,Article 863,"in person. Those would be things like organic chemistry lab, physics lab, gross anatomy lab, those kind of things. And we think we're g"
864,Article 864,"oing to have about thirty thousand, twenty-eight to thirty thousand students coming back to the Tucson area. Normally, we would have fo"
865,Article 865,rty-five thousand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And your office told us that the only mandate for testing is for those living on campus. You just 
866,Article 866,mentioned dorms there. DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Right. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like five thousand of your students live in dorms. Th
867,Article 867,at-- that means the majority don't live on campus. So-- so isn't this exposing everyone if you can't mandate testing for those who don'
868,Article 868,"t live in a dorm? DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think-- I think that what we're going to do is we will try to test everyone that comes on"
869,Article 869,"campus. What I would like, and, of course, what we would all like is a ten second-- ten-cent test that we could test everyone every day"
870,Article 870,". We-- we think that we can test everybody who comes back to campus in person, but we can't test them every day using an antigen test, "
871,Article 871,which is what we're using to look at our students that are coming into-- to the dorms. We-- we think that we've got a random testing pr
872,Article 872,"otocol that we've got in place, but I would like to see us test at least once a week everybody who comes on campus face to face."
873,Article 873,MARGARET BRENNAN: So Notre Dame mandated testing for students on campus. And I'm sure you know that they have had an outbreak–
874,Article 874,DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that has caused them to put things on hold for at least a few weeks. If they tried and fa

876,Article 876,"I think they did the same thing that we did, which is test students when they came into the dorms, but I'm not sure if they were tested"
877,Article 877,"-- because they'd only been in class, just like at UNC Chapel Hill, they'd only been in class for a week or so. I think the big issue i"
878,Article 878,s off-campus activity. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: I think we all know that we can control things in the classroom and
879,Article 879,"on campus and in the student union and not having large gatherings of people on campus in official venues. The problem is, what I've se"
880,Article 880,"en is that others such as Kansas, even Arizona State, other universities, Purdue, have gone aggressively off campus to try to break up "
881,Article 881,large gatherings and parties. And that's where most of the transmission has occurred. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you expel a student if th
882,Article 882,"ey violated one of your requests? I mean, how do you force people to behave in their own best interest-- DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah."
883,Article 883,MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're-- DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah. I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --teenagers and in their early twenties?

886,Article 886,"and freedom. But that is going to be-- that'll go through the dean of students and code of conduct. And, yes, they can be expelled. Wha"
887,Article 887,"t-- what I think we're moving into is we-- we've done a very good job of testing, contact tracing. We've got COVID-19 Watch, which is a"

1779,Article 1779,cenes out of New York are going to be shocking. I think that the hospitals in the next two weeks are going to be at the brink of being 
1780,Article 1780,overwhelmed and we're going to start to see places like Javits Convention Center and other facilities used to start to house people. Th
1781,Article 1781,ey're going to start getting thousands of admissions coming into that city. And this was infection that started two weeks ago. The time
1782,Article 1782,to hospitalization is nine to 12 days. I think there's other cities that are at extreme risk. New Orleans is at very high risk and they
1783,Article 1783,'re not taking appropriate measures. This is a sticky virus. We're learning that much more of the transmission probably happens from to
1784,Article 1784,uching contaminated surfaces. So any city that has a mass transit system is probably at risk and needs to be taking very aggressive ste
1785,Article 1785,"ps. Cities like Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Boston. You've seen San Francisco implement tough measures. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah."
1786,Article 1786,DR. GOTTLIEB: Illinois recently implemented tough measures. We need to continue that right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there an existing 
1787,Article 1787,"antiviral drug that is effective and- in at least containing this or preventing someone from getting seriously ill? DR. GOTTLIEB: No, t"
1788,Article 1788,"here's drugs that look promising, there's drugs that are in- in proper trials. We really need to continue to conduct research to figure"
1789,Article 1789,"out what works. Right now, there is no drug that looks like it's proven so overwhelming in early stage clinical trials that we can say "
1790,Article 1790,"it's highly promising. There's drugs that suggest that they may have activity against this virus. But the other question is, when you i"

1793,Article 1793,"t the flu, for example, with drugs like Tamiflu. We introduced them earlier in the course of the illness and that's where they have the"
1794,Article 1794,greatest benefit. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would agree with Dr. Fauci that there needs to be clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine and 
1795,Article 1795,"azithromycin, which the president said he thinks is already effective? DR. GOTTLIEB: Absolutely, and that may not be the drug that ends"
1796,Article 1796,up holding to his promise. The study that looked at that drug and showed activity was- was a study that involved about 20 patients and 
1797,Article 1797,only six in the arm that showed the benefit. And the benefit that they showed was that they decrease the amount of virus in their- in t
1798,Article 1798,"heir noses when you did nasal swabs in those patients. So it could very well be that the drug is reducing viral shedding, but having no"
1799,Article 1799,impact on the clinical course of those patients. So the data on that is very preliminary. What we need to do is what we call a master p
1800,Article 1800,"rotocol, where we basically test a lot of drugs at once. We randomize patients to different treatments so everyone gets a treatment if "
1801,Article 1801,they need it and we figure out which is working the best. That's what we did with Ebola. We came up with some very-- MARGARET BRENNAN: 
1802,Article 1802,Yeah. DR. GOTTLIEB: --effective treatments against Ebola. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration announced this past week that the 
1803,Article 1803,"first trial through NIH of a vaccine was started out in Seattle. Given the timeline for this, do resources need to be refocused from a "
1804,Article 1804,"vaccine into some of the treatments that- that you are talking about? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think absolutely. We could have a drug, a potenti"

1806,Article 1806,when you look at some of the approaches where companies are developing antibodies that directly target the virus. I think this is highl
1807,Article 1807,y promising. We need to be putting a lot of resources into that. Senator Daines introduced a provision in Capitol Hill that may be incl

1810,Article 1810,"literally millions of doses available. Now, what's going to happen is a lot of those drugs won't work and we're going to end up throwin"
1811,Article 1811,"g away the drug that we manufactured. But I think that's a small price to pay for the benefit of having drug available, if in fact one "

1813,Article 1813,"you see us being able to plan about going back to normal life? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's going to be a slow transition. I think "
1814,Article 1814,"that the epidemic right now that's underway is probably going to peak sometime in April, probably late April and tail off into May and "
1815,Article 1815,June and hopefully transmission will be broken off in July and August. We need to plan for what we're going to do in the fall to preven
1816,Article 1816,t another epidemic and outbreak. But life's never going to be perfectly normal till we get to a vaccine. We're always going to have to

2514,Article 2514,hat happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack 
2515,Article 2515,"into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
2516,Article 2516,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, "
2517,Article 2517,and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you assess a
2518,Article 2518,t this point that we are escalating towards a regional war or that we are taking a step back? Is there risk of escalation?
2519,Article 2519,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
2520,Article 2520,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with

2527,Article 2527,ecided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very stron

2532,Article 2532,"the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is "

2540,Article 2540,say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of 
2541,Article 2541,"the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor. What is reality? AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not"
2542,Article 2542,obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there. We had constructive talks in Egypt a few day
2543,Article 2543,s ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game. MARGARET BRENNAN:

2845,Article 2845,"mmunity. So, a lot of adults have baseline immunity. So, when you look at the statistics on who's going to the emergency room, overall,"
2846,Article 2846,"about 2.4 percent of all emergency room visits are for Covid right now. But for the cohort over the age of 65, that's about 3.4 percent"
2847,Article 2847,". So, 3.4 percent of all people over the age of 65 who go to the emergency room for any reason are going there for Covid."
2848,Article 2848,"In children under the age of five, it's 5.8 percent. So, a higher proportion of kids who go to the emergency room are going to the emer"
2849,Article 2849,gency room for Covid. They're getting sick because they don't have baseline immunity. They haven't been infected before. They haven't b
2850,Article 2850,een vaccinated. I think part of it's also that parents are more likely to take a sick child to the emergency room than take themselves 
2851,Article 2851,"to the emergency room. So, that's some of what's baked into that. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's hard to get a kid vaccinated though."
2852,Article 2852,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's hard to - MARGARET BRENNAN: To find a - SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Find a place that vaccinates toddlers. So, I - if you thin"

4527,Article 4527,hat happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack 
4528,Article 4528,"into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
4529,Article 4529,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, "
4530,Article 4530,and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you assess a
4531,Article 4531,t this point that we are escalating towards a regional war or that we are taking a step back? Is there risk of escalation?
4532,Article 4532,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
4533,Article 4533,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with
4534,Article 4534,"Israel on October 8. And they have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel since then. We give a chance to diplomacy, and we hope "

4540,Article 4540,ecided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very stron

4544,Article 4544,"for miscalculation. And I think part of his regional visit is to make sure that everything is under control. Again, the U.S. posture in"
4545,Article 4545,"the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is "

4550,Article 4550,"As Secretary Blinken said a few days ago, the U.S. put forward a bridging proposal, which was accepted by Israel, and now it's up to Ha"

4553,Article 4553,say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of 
4554,Article 4554,"the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor. What is reality? AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not"
4555,Article 4555,obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there. We had constructive talks in Egypt a few day
4556,Article 4556,s ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game. MARGARET BRENNAN:

4846,Article 4846,"till shedding some virus, although your infectivity probably has come down a lot when you're five, six days out. I think for Americans "
4847,Article 4847,"who are going into settings where there's people who are at risk, where they work in confined spaces, where people may be vulnerable, t"
4848,Article 4848,hey may need to take some added precautions if they're recovering from an infection and still testing positive on the antigen test. The
4849,Article 4849,"re's no really, you know, golden rule in terms of when people aren't infective anymore. If you want to be vigilant, use an antigen test"
4850,Article 4850,"to look for that. In terms of when to get the vaccine, for most Americans getting it sometime in September, or maybe early October is g"
4851,Article 4851,oing to be sufficient to try to protect them from that winter surge. I think a lot of Americans were worried about the current surge an
4852,Article 4852,"d there's still a lot of virus around, could go out and get the vaccine right now because they could still catch Covid from this curren"
4853,Article 4853,"t wave of infection. For people who have been infected, they likely have several months of good protection from that recent infection. "
4854,Article 4854,"So, they may want to wait a little bit longer, that way when they do get vaccinated, maybe late October, that vaccine will extend furth"
4855,Article 4855,"er. Because we know that the immunity provided by the vaccines only lasts a defined period of time, three, four, five months."
4856,Article 4856,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's - it's a serious strain, I'll - I'll - I'll say that. The CDC said that they saw a high number of children u"
4857,Article 4857,"nder five going to the ER. Why are kids being impacted like that? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, part of that is that kids don't have baseline i"
4858,Article 4858,"mmunity. So, a lot of adults have baseline immunity. So, when you look at the statistics on who's going to the emergency room, overall,"
4859,Article 4859,"about 2.4 percent of all emergency room visits are for Covid right now. But for the cohort over the age of 65, that's about 3.4 percent"
4860,Article 4860,". So, 3.4 percent of all people over the age of 65 who go to the emergency room for any reason are going there for Covid."
4861,Article 4861,"In children under the age of five, it's 5.8 percent. So, a higher proportion of kids who go to the emergency room are going to the emer"
4862,Article 4862,gency room for Covid. They're getting sick because they don't have baseline immunity. They haven't been infected before. They haven't b
4863,Article 4863,een vaccinated. I think part of it's also that parents are more likely to take a sick child to the emergency room than take themselves 
4864,Article 4864,"to the emergency room. So, that's some of what's baked into that. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's hard to get a kid vaccinated though."
4865,Article 4865,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's hard to - MARGARET BRENNAN: To find a - SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Find a place that vaccinates toddlers. So, I - if you thin"
