501,Article 501,hat happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack 
502,Article 502,"into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
503,Article 503,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, "
504,Article 504,and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you assess a
505,Article 505,t this point that we are escalating towards a regional war or that we are taking a step back? Is there risk of escalation?
506,Article 506,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
507,Article 507,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with

514,Article 514,ecided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very stron

516,Article 516,. What is it that you think General C.Q. Brown will do when he arrives in Israel later today? Is this further planning for potential at

518,Article 518,"for miscalculation. And I think part of his regional visit is to make sure that everything is under control. Again, the U.S. posture in"
519,Article 519,"the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is "

527,Article 527,say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of 
528,Article 528,"the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor. What is reality? AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not"
529,Article 529,obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there. We had constructive talks in Egypt a few day
530,Article 530,s ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game. MARGARET BRENNAN:

631,Article 631,"olitics. And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage – first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that "
632,Article 632,even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide – it's broad. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
633,Article 633,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that, whether it's the Black lives"

635,Article 635,"actics, the strategies are inconvenient. And I think that that's just the way that we've done it, especially when we're nervous about a"

678,Article 678,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN (D-NY): Hey, how are you doing, Margaret? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm doing well. You know, you were at the DNC this "

684,Article 684,"t - that is what we've been working on. When Kamala Harris talks about freedom, patriotism, reproductive freedom, economic freedom, fre"
685,Article 685,"edom to breathe clean air and water, that is what folks, regardless of party, they want to believe in something, to be for something. A"
686,Article 686,nd she has delivered that. And I think over the next 72 days we're going to see that momentum continue to build. MARGARET BRENNAN: The 
687,Article 687,former speaker points to five seats in New York state as determining the difference between Democrats having a minority or majority spo
688,Article 688,t in Congress. You are one of those seats. Do you think that now Democrats have a better shot at gaining the majority? REPRESENTATIVE P
689,Article 689,"AT RYAN: Yes, no doubt. MARGARET BRENNAN: Definitely? REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: No doubt. It's just been a sea change. I mean, I won my "

692,Article 692,"important, I think, to understand, it's one thing to be against a set of things - MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But"
693,Article 693,"- but to be for a set of things and a set - and for core freedoms, that is - that's rallying people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so then le"
694,Article 694,"t's put this in specific terms because some of the policies aren't that different from Joe Biden's policies. In fact, they're exactly t"
695,Article 695,"he same on - on the border. And you, when you issued that statement calling for Biden to step aside, you called for him to restore orde"
696,Article 696,r at the border. Your district has been hit with a lot of migrants being sent from New York City up to the Hudson Valley. What is any d
697,Article 697,ifferent about the Harris platform on the border? REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I served 27 months in combat. I know what it means to secure
698,Article 698,a border. And I think foundational to the responsibilities of a nation state is to secure the border. That - that's not a partisan thin
699,Article 699,"g, that's a widely held view. So, I - I did, you know, call on and sort of call out President Biden in not doing enough. They've - they"
700,Article 700,'ve - they've - MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was the Biden-Harris policy. REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: They've stepped up. And wat we heard f

702,Article 702,"o secure the border, restore order at the border, but not lose who we are as Americans to welcome folks that want to come here, make a "
703,Article 703,"better life, serve our country, make it better and stronger. We can do both. We will do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but it's still not "
704,Article 704,articulated as a different policy in the specifics. We haven't heard the vice president at least say things in detail. But on the issue
705,Article 705,"of abortion, which is already protected in New York state up to 24 weeks, after that point it has to be that the mother's life is at ri"
706,Article 706,"sk for that procedure to be taken, but it's going to be on the ballot in some form or fashion in November. Do you think that this is ju"
707,Article 707,st about driving up turnout? REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding - MARGARET BRENNAN: It's already protected (INAUDIBLE).
708,Article 708,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding ideology of our country is about freedom. People don't forget that just two years ago the -
709,Article 709,Trump's appointees to the Supreme Court ripped away a fundamental freedom. There have been more states across the country now taking aw

714,Article 714,e in my district. MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump and Vance haven't been very clear on the Comstock Act. I asked vice - I asked J.D. Vance a lo

716,Article 716,"your call for Joe Biden to step aside, you also pointed to that as a Biden-Harris problem. In fact, you said it was a strategic and a m"
717,Article 717,"oral failure, that withdraw. The vice president says she was that last person in the room on that decision. Is that failure also hers?"
718,Article 718,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: We've got to stop assigning partisan blame on fundamental things like our national security. MARGARET BRENNAN:
719,Article 719,"You said that. REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I - I said it as an American. I said it as someone who served in combat, who had friends that s"

723,Article 723,o be able to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I bring that up because we are coming up on the three- year anniversary of that withdraw and th

747,Article 747,"n the mortgage business. And the last thing that you want to do is the Kamala - the Vice President Harris plan, which is to put $25,000"

750,Article 750,"e demand side up without fixing supply, what happens to pricing? You're actually exasperating the problem. Prices for housing goes up."
751,Article 751,"So, the solution that President Trump's talking about, and it's the correct solution, is to eliminate permitting reform, get permitting"
752,Article 752,"reform, make it easier for developers, make it easier for people to develop and build houses, get rid of regulations. That's the - that"
753,Article 753,'s the free market principles that we believe in. And we know are the correct way to do it. I mean if - when you think about it -
754,Article 754,MARGARET BRENNAN: Well - GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Listen – go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. The vice president said she also wants to cr
755,Article 755,"eate 3 million homes. So, she is talking about adding to supply. But on the Republican Party platform, because we went to look at it, i"
756,Article 756,"t says that Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation - that's really a Fed decision, right - but also open portions"
757,Article 757,of federal lands to allow for new home construction. Sounds very much the same as the Harris plan. And then promote home ownership thro

759,Article 759,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, there are so many first-time home buyer programs right now. And my question to you - and this is"
760,Article 760,a great question for Vice President Harris - who's going to build the 3 million homes? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: I m

767,Article 767,"Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person. But if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked "
768,Article 768,"in the private sector. They've - and so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and "
769,Article 769,expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works. That's - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR KEVIN STIT

798,Article 798,"): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is a Covid summer surge. The CDC says we may be at the peak or about to pass it now."
799,Article 799,The Biden administration has just made free testing available that will come at the end of the month. The new booster shot was just app
800,Article 800,roved. Is this just playing catch up here? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think so. I think the timing's about right in terms of rolling out t
801,Article 801,"he vaccine and the tests that will be available for people in the winter time. Look, we've had these summer surges and then a subsequen"
802,Article 802,"t winter surge now a couple of seasons in a row. So, I think we need to start to understand, this is probably the predictable pattern f"
803,Article 803,or this virus for the foreseeable future. It's going to be hard to have a vaccine available earlier than they have had it this year. Th
804,Article 804,"ey've got the vaccine out earlier than they have in the past, in part to try to time it with the flu vaccine, so that when people go in"
805,Article 805,"to the pharmacy, they can get both a Covid vaccine and a flu vaccine, which I think is going to be important for a lot of older America"
806,Article 806,"ns. It is the case that we do see these summer surges, and we will have to think about how we protect people better in the future. I th"
807,Article 807,"ink the idea of having a dual vaccine, having two vaccines per year, that may be a difficult thing just from a manufacturing and a prod"
808,Article 808,"uction standpoint. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this booster is about KP.2 variant. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: KP.3 is what is s"
809,Article 809,"wirling around now apparently. It will still protect you? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so the data right now, it's pre-clinical data. So, it's "
810,Article 810,data looking at whether or not the antibodies that are produced as a result of getting vaccinated from KP.2 will also neutralize this K
811,Article 811,P.3 strain. That data looks encouraging. And we rely on that data. That neutralizing antibody days. We've historically relied on it. An
812,Article 812,"d it's been a good proxy for how effective the vaccine is going to be. So, this vaccine should protect against KP.3. About a third of t"
813,Article 813,"he cases of KP.3 right now. I don't believe that the winter surge, and we're likely to see a winter surge of Covid, is going to be from"
814,Article 814,"KP.3. Right now, if you look across the country, Covid cases are starting to decline in most parts of the country. Perhaps the northeas"
815,Article 815,"t is still rising, parts of the west. States like Utah and Colorado. But we should be through most of this summer surge. Cases should s"
816,Article 816,"tart to continue to come down. And in what ultimately emerges in the wintertime, we don't know yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when do you g"
817,Article 817,"et it? The vaccine, that is. And the guidance from the CDC is, once your fever breaks, count five days and you're good to go. That's no"
818,Article 818,"t necessarily going to stop transmission, is it? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think people who get Covid and recover from Covid, probab"
819,Article 819,"ly should use an antigen test to see when they're no longer infectious. If you're still registering on an antigen test, you're likely s"
820,Article 820,"till shedding some virus, although your infectivity probably has come down a lot when you're five, six days out. I think for Americans "
821,Article 821,"who are going into settings where there's people who are at risk, where they work in confined spaces, where people may be vulnerable, t"
822,Article 822,hey may need to take some added precautions if they're recovering from an infection and still testing positive on the antigen test. The
823,Article 823,"re's no really, you know, golden rule in terms of when people aren't infective anymore. If you want to be vigilant, use an antigen test"
824,Article 824,"to look for that. In terms of when to get the vaccine, for most Americans getting it sometime in September, or maybe early October is g"
825,Article 825,oing to be sufficient to try to protect them from that winter surge. I think a lot of Americans were worried about the current surge an
826,Article 826,"d there's still a lot of virus around, could go out and get the vaccine right now because they could still catch Covid from this curren"
827,Article 827,"t wave of infection. For people who have been infected, they likely have several months of good protection from that recent infection. "
828,Article 828,"So, they may want to wait a little bit longer, that way when they do get vaccinated, maybe late October, that vaccine will extend furth"
829,Article 829,"er. Because we know that the immunity provided by the vaccines only lasts a defined period of time, three, four, five months."
830,Article 830,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's - it's a serious strain, I'll - I'll - I'll say that. The CDC said that they saw a high number of children u"
831,Article 831,"nder five going to the ER. Why are kids being impacted like that? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, part of that is that kids don't have baseline i"
832,Article 832,"mmunity. So, a lot of adults have baseline immunity. So, when you look at the statistics on who's going to the emergency room, overall,"
833,Article 833,"about 2.4 percent of all emergency room visits are for Covid right now. But for the cohort over the age of 65, that's about 3.4 percent"
834,Article 834,". So, 3.4 percent of all people over the age of 65 who go to the emergency room for any reason are going there for Covid."
835,Article 835,"In children under the age of five, it's 5.8 percent. So, a higher proportion of kids who go to the emergency room are going to the emer"
836,Article 836,gency room for Covid. They're getting sick because they don't have baseline immunity. They haven't been infected before. They haven't b
837,Article 837,een vaccinated. I think part of it's also that parents are more likely to take a sick child to the emergency room than take themselves 
838,Article 838,"to the emergency room. So, that's some of what's baked into that. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's hard to get a kid vaccinated though."
839,Article 839,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's hard to - MARGARET BRENNAN: To find a - SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Find a place that vaccinates toddlers. So, I - if you thin"
840,Article 840,"k of CVS, for example, most of their pharmacies won't vaccinate toddlers. It's only the pharmacies that have mini (ph) clinics. A lot o"
841,Article 841,f pediatricians don't stock the under five vaccine because a lot of parents aren't asking for it. If your pediatrician doesn't have the
842,Article 842,"vaccine, and you want to vaccinate your child, you can ask them to order it and it should be available within 24 to 48 hours."
843,Article 843,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Gottlieb, I have so many more questions for you but we have to leave it there for right now."
844,Article 844,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank yo

2548,Article 2548,be here. I know a lot of people have been talking about a recession. I do not see a recession on the horizon here. The U.S. economy is

2577,Article 2577,I agreed fundamentally on what the issue was. I just didn't agree on how to solve the issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the steel and aluminu

2588,Article 2588,"MARGARET BRENNAN:  --to spend more? COHN: --not lowering. We actually gave them expensing of CapEx. For the first five years, they can "

2592,Article 2592,"the economy, to build facilities, to go out and hire people, to drive wages, we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they "

2601,Article 2601,itive again with the rest of the world. We lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. So we now have a corporate tax rate that is co
2602,Article 2602,"mpetitive with the rest of the world. Yes, we lowered corporate tax rates, and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars "
2603,Article 2603,"a year to do that. But it stimulates huge economic growth. The businesses in the United States now can thrive, which means that they ca"
2604,Article 2604,"n grow. They can go out and hire people, which we've seen. We've seen record unemployment. We've seen record unemployment rates down to"
2605,Article 2605,3.5 percent. We've seen wage growth. We've seen 3 percent plus wage growth. And most importantly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You put this all o
2606,Article 2606,n the tax law? COHN: We've seen- a lot of it has to do with tax law. It has to. We've seen higher-end wage growth at the bottom pay sca
2607,Article 2607,"le than we have at the top. So we're seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate, we're seeing "
2608,Article 2608,"that happen, and that is happening in the last couple of years. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a whole debate about the contribution to the "
2609,Article 2609,"deficit. But I want to put that aside here because I want to focus in on something-- COHN: Oh, please don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want t"
2610,Article 2610,"o focus in on something, though, that- that is really resonating politically. And it is this broader argument that this country somehow"
2611,Article 2611,"is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor. And you've even had Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, you've had Hank Paul"
2612,Article 2612,"son, former Treasury secretary, former head of Goldman Sachs. I know you know him. They've said that they're all concerned about income"

2618,Article 2618,"ening. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael Bloomberg says about this tax law, nearly all the money goes to people like me who don't need it. This"
2619,Article 2619,"is a guy who knows Wall Street, who is a billionaire. He's saying that the tax law is- is only advantaging people like him."
2620,Article 2620,"COHN: I'd love to know how it's advantaging him. I'd love to see that because at the end of the day, we have lowered rates. I'll agree "
2621,Article 2621,"that we've lowered rates. We have broadened the base, meaning that we make more of your income taxable. That's basic tax policy. Lower "

2630,Article 2630,"hat would the impact of those policies be from your perspective? COHN: Look, our tax system in the United States is very, very progress"
2631,Article 2631,ive. We have-- over 50 percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax. So if you're going to coll

2633,Article 2633,it's going to come from the top 10 percent of workers. That's where-- that's where you can find the taxable income. I think that we wil
2634,Article 2634,"l end up doing that. We will potentially need to do that. But these fangled plans that they're coming up with, we don't need to do thin"
2635,Article 2635,"gs like that to collect more income from people. We have a basic tax system that works, and we can do some basic fundamental things, if"

2637,Article 2637,nd we don't talk about them in the same sentence. We we collect taxes and then we spend. And Congress never thinks about how much money
